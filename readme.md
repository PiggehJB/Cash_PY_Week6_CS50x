My take on CS50x's week 6 problem "cash" 
(https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/1/cash/)

Note: I did this at 3:49 am because I'm bored out of my mind, so, the code may be sloppy and less optimal, apologies.

WARNING: This code is for educational purposes only! I do not promote stealing or breaking the academic integrity code of conduct.

Missing Criteria:

"So that we can automate some tests of your code, be sure that your programâ€™s last line of output is only the minimum number of coins possible: an integer followed by \n."

I didn't do this as to colorize my code since I'm not submitting this since this is for educational uses of other students. (Makes it easier to see what's going on in the program)
